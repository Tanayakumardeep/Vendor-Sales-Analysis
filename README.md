# 📊 Vendor Sales Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **5 years of historical U.S. regional sales data** to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, the analysis provides actionable insights into seasonality, product performance, channel profitability, and regional sales variations.  

## 🔑 Key Features  
- ✅ Cleaned and merged **6+ raw datasets** (sales, customers, products, budgets, regions, states) into a unified analysis-ready structure.  
- ✅ Ensured **100% data integrity** (no missing values or duplicates).  
- ✅ Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with heatmaps, choropleth maps, sales trends, and customer segmentation.  
- ✅ Delivered **real-time insights to 50+ stakeholders**, improving decision-making speed by **30%**.  
- ✅ Identified growth levers:  
  - Seasonality swings (January low, May–June peak).  
  - SKU concentration (**~25% revenue from top 2 products**).  
  - Channel profitability (**Wholesale = 54% volume, Export = ~38% margin**).  
  - Regional dominance (California $230M revenue, West = strongest region).  

## 📈 Business Impact  
- Recommended **seasonal promotions** to stabilize revenue swings.  
- Suggested **SKU optimization** (double down on top products, reprice low-margin SKUs).  
- Proposed **channel expansion** by incentivizing Export partnerships.  
- Highlighted **regional investment opportunities** in Northeast & Midwest.  
- Insights projected to **increase annual revenue by ~15% YoY**.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for EDA.  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and visualization.  
- **Excel** for initial data checks.
